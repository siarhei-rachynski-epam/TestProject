# Test Project

This repository is sandbox for various test tasks such as
* playing with Git
* building Java app with Maven in Jenkins pipeline (link)[https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven]

[below is copy from a repo in github] (https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app)
The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
